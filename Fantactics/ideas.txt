A game of strategy, a game of fun.

Gold, gold is what builds you units.
You get new gold every turn, the more territory you control,
the more gold you get.

What is the goal? To capture the enemy "Home Base"

But who should I play as?

Humans are balanced.
Elves are fast.
Goblins are aggressive.
Wizards control.

How do I capture territory? control points (do not have to have units on them)
